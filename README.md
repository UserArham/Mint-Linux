# Functional Linux Mint Siumulator from JPCLinux.
Welcome to the lore everyone! Ready to explore Linux Mint? Linux Mint is unblockable, and highly safe from Github.
This has a lot using Tailwind CSS and React (somehow Svelte).
This is made of mock.

# This can sometimes lead to 25% failing restrictions by...
- Wrong gitgnore or no gitgnore (No gitgnore is default)
- Editing wrongly by mistake
- Tailwind not secure with wrong CSS
# Why it do not run on older devices?
It was not compatible with those devices by file system reachment or with phones under Android 4.3 (Jellybean) and under iOS 5.
The relationship with this newly made repo does not support older Samsung or Apple devices if it was not updated.
However, if this was an phone from iOS 4/Android Honeycomb to iOS 5/Android Jellybean, you may use it.
# Can you run inside Windows?
Running type: It must be Windows 7 Professional or higher.
# Linux Mint conclusion
This simulation was made by NanoTech, as this was someday made with Svelte too.
